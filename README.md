# ‚öô PIXI Boilerplate

This project is used as a boilerplate for tasks in the PixiJS course in Boom.dev. Takes care of loading assets and intiliazing the scene. Just drop your images and sounds, set your viewport size and start coding. This is a fork of [PixiJS Boilerplate](https://github.com/dopamine-lab/pixi-boilerplate)

Includes:

- üì¶ Bundling via Webpack
- üèù Scene management
- ‚ú® Out of the box loader with progress bar, see `src/scenes/Splash.js`
- üìê Viewport fitting and resize handling, see `Application.setupViewport()` in `src/core/Application.js`

| `npm start`     | Build project and open web server running project                               |
| `npm run build` | Builds code bundle with production settings (minification, uglification, etc..) |

## Writing Code

After cloning the repo, run `npm install` from your project directory. Then, you can start the local development
server by running `npm start`.

After starting the development server with `npm start`, you can edit any files in the `src` folder
and webpack will automatically recompile and reload your server (available at `http://localhost:8080`
by default).

### Scenes

Easily switch different Scenes which are just PIXI.Containers

```
await this.switchScene(Splash, { scene: 'splash' });
await this.currentScene.finish;

this.switchScene(Play, { scene: 'play' });
```

### Parsing Spritesheets

The AssetManager class has parsing and caching spritesheets internally. You can use spritesheets for animations via PIXI.AnimatedSprite.

```
import fire from './static/fire.json';

...

await Assets.prepareSpritesheets([
  { texture: 'fire', data: fire }
]);
```

### Code Linter

Eslint is used to ensure a unified code base. Feel free to edit the config in `.eslintrc.json` as per your needs.
To run the linter and fix some problems automatically use

```
npm run lintfix
```

## Customizing Template

### Vite

If you want to customize your build, you can modify the `vite.config.js` file.

## Deploying Code

After you run the `npm run build` command, your code will be built into a bundle located at
`dist` along with any other assets you project depended.

If you put the contents of the `dist` folder in a publicly-accessible location (say something like `http://mycoolserver.com`),
you should be able to open `http://mycoolserver.com/index.html` and play your game.
